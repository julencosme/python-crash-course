Protists: There about 200,000 species in the Kingdom Protista. All protists are
eukaryotes, and almost all protists are aquatic. They are mostly defined by what
they are NOT. For example, they are not archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, or
animals. Green algae and Red algae are both in the Kingdom Protista.
